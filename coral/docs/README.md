## Tip

You can use `alex` ( 📃 [documentation](https://alexjs.com/) | 🐙 [repository](https://github.com/get-alex/alex)) as an **optional** linting tool. It checks text documents and highlights language that potentially could be insensitive or inconsiderate.

- run it with `pnpm --silent dlx alex` to lint text files.
