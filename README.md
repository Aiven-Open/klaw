# Kafkawize

Kafkawize is fully opensource. ðŸ¥³ All the features of the Kafkawize are available at no cost. 

Kafkawize is a Self service Apache Kafka Topic Management/Governance tool/portal. It is a web application which automates the process of creating and browsing Kafka topics, acls, avro schemas, connectors by introducing roles/authorizations to users of various teams of an organization.

With several downloads every week, many more companies which did not adopt a solution, can happily move away from managing kafka configs in excelsheets, confluence, wiki pages, git etc.
