Klaw is fully opensource. ðŸ¥³

Klaw is a self-service Apache KafkaÂ® Topic Management/Governance tool/portal. It is a web application which automates the process of creating and browsing Apache Kafka topics, acls, avro schemas, connectors by introducing roles/authorizations to users of various teams of an organization.

With several downloads every week, many more companies which did not adopt a solution, can happily move away from managing Apache Kafka configs in excelsheets, confluence, wiki pages, git etc.

## Built With

- Bootstrap UI, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
  - A maven wrapper, mvnw is included in the Klaw Git Repo
- Java (Jdk 17, 21), Spring boot 3, Spring security, SQL, Apache Kafka Admin client

## Questions and Answers

We encourage everyone to ask question, if you have a question someone else definitely does too.

- [Klaw Community Support](https://aiven.io/community/forum/c/open-source/12)
- [Klaw GitHub discussions](https://github.com/aiven/klaw/discussions)

The Klaw team will cross post questions and answers across both forums. The Klaw Community Support forum, which is hosted and supported by Aiven directly, has more visibility for other interested parties, so we would encourage questions to be asked there. We will respond and answer questions in both GitHub discussions and the Community Forum.

## Install

### Manual

##### Use the Maven Wrapper

- ./mvnw clean install

##### Use your own Maven

- mvn clean install

Optional step : For new React UI assets, make sure pnpm is pre installed which is required to build coral assets.

Builds two artifacts core/target/klaw-<version>.jar and cluster-api/target/cluster-api-<version>.jar

and follow steps defined at https://klaw-project.io/docs or run the binaries like below

java -jar core/target/klaw-<version>.jar

java -jar cluster-api/target/cluster-api-<version>.jar --spring.config.location=cluster-api/target/classes/application.properties

### With `make`

1. Clone this repo containing two maven modules (core and cluster-api) : `git clone git@github.com:aiven/klaw.git`
2. Run `make` to install dependencies and setup both Klaw Core and the Klaw-Cluster-Api
3. [Optional] edit any configs using `make edit-core-config` for Klaw Core or `make edit-cluster-api-config` for Klaw-Cluster-API
4. To run, you can use `make run-core` and `make run-cluster-api` in different terminal windows or you can run `make -j2 run-core run-cluster-api` to execute both (NOTE: this will mix output and make debugging harder)

### With `docker`

#### Dockerhub

Each official release is available on docker in the two repositories.
The [klaw-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/aivenoy/klaw-core) docker hub page contains an example docker-compose file which will help download and deploy Klaw.
The [cluster-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/aivenoy/klaw-cluster-api) can also be found separately on docker hub.

#### Locally

This project also has the ability to build and deploy local docker images using scripts provided in Klaw/docker-scripts .
