# Klaw

Klaw is fully opensource. ðŸ¥³ 

Klaw is a self-service Apache KafkaÂ® Topic Management/Governance tool/portal. It is a web application which automates the process of creating and browsing Apache Kafka topics, acls, avro schemas, connectors by introducing roles/authorizations to users of various teams of an organization.

With several downloads every week, many more companies which did not adopt a solution, can happily move away from managing Apache Kafka configs in excelsheets, confluence, wiki pages, git etc. 

## Built With

* Bootstrap UI, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS 
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* Java, Spring boot, Spring security, SQL, Apache Kafka Admin client
