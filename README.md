# Klaw

Klaw is fully opensource. ðŸ¥³ 

Klaw is a self-service Apache KafkaÂ® Topic Management/Governance tool/portal. It is a web application which automates the process of creating and browsing Apache Kafka topics, acls, avro schemas, connectors by introducing roles/authorizations to users of various teams of an organization.

With several downloads every week, many more companies which did not adopt a solution, can happily move away from managing Apache Kafka configs in excelsheets, confluence, wiki pages, git etc. 

## Built With

* Bootstrap UI, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS 
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* Java, Spring boot, Spring security, SQL, Apache Kafka Admin client

## Install

### Manual
mvn clean install

Optional step : For new React UI assets, make sure pnpm is pre installed which is required to build coral assets.

Builds two artifacts core/target/klaw-<version>.jar and cluster-api/target/cluster-api-<version>.jar

and follow steps defined at https://klaw-project.io/docs or run the binaries like below

java -jar core/target/klaw-<version>.jar

java -jar cluster-api/target/cluster-api-<version>.jar --spring.config.location=cluster-api/target/classes/application.properties

### With `make`

1. Clone this repo containing two maven modules (core and cluster-api) : `git clone git@github.com:aiven/klaw.git`
2. Run `make` to install dependencies and setup both Klaw Core and the Klaw-Cluster-Api
3. [Optional] edit any configs using `make edit-core-config` for Klaw Core or `make edit-cluster-api-config` for Klaw-Cluster-API
4. To run, you can use `make run-core` and `make run-cluster-api` in different terminal windows or you can run `make -j2 run-core run-cluster-api` to execute both (NOTE: this will mix output and make debugging harder)

### With `docker`
#### Dockerhub
Each official release is available on docker in the two repositories.
The [klaw-core](https://hub.docker.com/r/aivenoy/klaw-core) docker hub page contains an example docker-compose file which will help download and deploy Klaw. 
The [cluster-api](https://hub.docker.com/r/aivenoy/klaw-cluster-api) can also be found separately on docker hub.

#### Locally
This project also has the ability to build and deploy local docker images using scripts provided in Klaw/docker-scripts .
