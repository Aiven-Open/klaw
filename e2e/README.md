# E2E tests

This is a work in progress, so a documentation will follow!

## Current state
- to run tests on a local machine, use `pnpm test-local`
    - Please note that the tests are a proof-of-concept right now. We won't tackle adding tests before we have the setup of everything figured out, for example how to add consistent test data etc.   
- scripts with a `__` as prefixed are meant to be used internally
- the related github workflow is [end-to-end-tests.yaml](../.github/workflows/end-to-end-tests.yaml)
