# 'coral-workflow' runs the jobs for coral when

# - & there are changes inside `coral` directory
# -> it does _not_ differentiate between a PR that is ready for review or a draft
#
# 'coral-workflow' runs the jobs for coral when

# - & there are changes detected in the directories cluster-api and core
#     the file pom.xml
# - & the PR is not in DRAFT status
# - OR the PR is in draft status, but was marked as "Ready for review"
