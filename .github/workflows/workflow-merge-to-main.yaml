# This workflow is called when a pull request is approved
# which targets the protected branch `main`.
# The job `merge-to-main` ("Status check for enabling merging to main")
# is a required status check for our `main` branch.
# (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/statuses?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
# We can only merge to main when this job has run and is green.
# The workflow can be triggered manually, too (that's why we need workflow_dispatch)
