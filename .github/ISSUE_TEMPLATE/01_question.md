  about: Please ask and answer questions here.

The Klaw team will cross post questions and answers across both forums. The Klaw Community Support forum, which is hosted and supported by Aiven directly, has more visibility for other interested parties, so we would encourage questions to be asked there. We will respond and answer questions in both GitHub discussions and the Community Forum.
