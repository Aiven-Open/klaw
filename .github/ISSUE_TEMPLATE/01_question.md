  about: Please ask and answer questions here.

The Klaw team will cross post questions and answers across both forums, the Klaw Community Support forum which is hosted and suppported by Aiven directly, has more visibility from SEO and from other interested parties and we would encourage questions to be asked there but will respond and answer questions in both github discussions and the Community Forum.
